# Kanban-Board
CS162 Kanban Assignment. This is an implementation of a To-Do list for users.
The boards are personalized and users have to login their accounts to make their boards



P.S. I have used some online resources guidance and help from the TAs and classmates
P.S. 2. Based on the discussion on the slack channel, I chose to treat the unittests as an optional part due to time constraint
